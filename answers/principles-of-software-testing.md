# Principles of software testing answers
## Exercise 1  
Mark: Hey, Jane, I just observed a __failure__ in our software: if the user has multiple surnames, our software doesn't allow them to sign in.  
Jane: Oh, that's awful. Let me debug the code so that I can find the __fault__ .  
Jane (a few minutes later): Mark, I found it! It was my __error__ . I programmed that part, but never thought of this case.  
Mark: No worries, Jane! Thanks for fixing it!  

## Exercise 2
This is __absence-of-errors fallacy__ at play. Apparently the system of _Books!_ is verified by the developers but it has not been validated - software does not deliver to its users what it promises.

## Exercise 3
Suzanne's can't find all bugs in the system because __exhaustive testing (2)__ is impossible.

## Exercise 4
__Testing early__ is an important principle in development of high-quality software but it does not directly relate to John's "only unit testing" approach. _Pesticide paradox_ is an idea that no single testing strategy allows the developer to uncover all bugs, _context-dependent tests_ means that the context in which the application is developed should influence the way that it is tested.
